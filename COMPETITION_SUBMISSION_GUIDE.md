## Technical Details

### What Happens When You Choose Existing Book?
- System pulls your book's title, genre, description, and word count
- Uses the manuscript file already uploaded with the book
- Links the competition submission to your book record
- Your book remains in your library (submissions are copies, not moves)

### Validation
- For new manuscripts: All fields (title, genre, synopsis, file) are required
- For existing books: Only book selection and terms agreement required
- System checks that you own the selected book
- Genre matching is enforced if competition specifies a genre

### After Submission
- Both methods create identical competition entries
- AI evaluation works the same way for both
- You can view submissions in "My Submissions" page
- Editing submissions is not allowed once submitted

## Tips for Success

1. **Prepare Your Synopsis**: Whether uploading new or using existing, a compelling synopsis helps the AI evaluation
2. **Check Genre Requirements**: Some competitions require specific genres
3. **Review Before Submitting**: Use the preview feature for existing books
4. **Author Statement**: Use this to provide context that helps evaluators understand your work
5. **Word Count Accuracy**: Be honest about word counts - it affects evaluation criteria
