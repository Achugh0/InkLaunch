# InkLaunch Deployment Guide

## 📸 Image Storage Options

Railway/Render use ephemeral storage - uploaded files don't persist. You have **two options**:

### Option 1: Image URLs (No Setup Required) ⚡
Users provide direct URLs to images from free services like Imgur, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.
- ✅ Zero setup
- ✅ Works immediately  
- ✅ Free
- ✅ Simple for users

**👉 [See IMAGE_URL_GUIDE.md for details](IMAGE_URL_GUIDE.md)**

### Option 2: AWS S3 (Full Upload Feature) 🔧
Professional file upload directly through the app with persistent storage.
- ✅ Better UX
- ✅ Professional
- ❌ Requires AWS setup
- ❌ ~$0.10/month

**👉 [See S3_SETUP_GUIDE.md for setup](S3_SETUP_GUIDE.md)**

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

The following deployment configurations have been added to fix the Railway build:

1. **nixpacks.toml** - System dependencies configuration
2. **Procfile** - Specifies how to run the app with Gunicorn
3. **runtime.txt** - Python version specification
4. **railway.json** - Railway-specific configuration
5. **.railwayignore** - Optimizes build by excluding unnecessary files
6. **requirements.txt** - Added Gunicorn, temporarily disabled Pillow
7. **S3 Integration** - Added AWS S3 support for persistent image storage (optional)
8. **URL Input** - Added image URL input option for users (no S3 needed)

## 🚀 Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. Railway should auto-detect the changes
  Optional - Only for file upload feature (otherwise users can use image URLsld
   - Check the build logs in Railway dashboard

### 2. Required Environment Variables

Add these in Railway Settings → Variables:

```bash
# Required
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/inklaunch?retryWrites=true&w=majority
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production-min-32-chars
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret-key-change-this-min-32-chars
FLASK_ENV=production
DEBUG=False

# Required for Image Storage (See S3_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=inklaunch-book-covers
AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Optional (for AI features)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key

# Email (Optional)
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USE_TLS=True
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=noreply@inklaunch.com

# Admin
ADMIN_EMAILS=your-admin-email@example.com
```

### 3. MongoDB Setup (If Not Done)

**Option A: MongoDB Atlas (Free Tier)**
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. Create free cluster
3. Create database user
4. Whitelist IP: 0.0.0.0/0 (allow all)
5. Get connection string
6. Add to Railway as MONGODB_URI

**Option B: Railway MongoDB Template**
1. In Railway dashboard
2. New → Database → MongoDB
3. Copy connection string
4. Add as MONGODB_URI variable

### 4. Generate Secret Keys

Run these commands to generate secure keys:

```bash
# Generate SECRET_KEY
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"

# Generate JWT_SECRET_KEY
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

### 5. Custom Domain Setup

In Railway:
1. Go to Settings → Domains
2. Click "Custom Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., inklaunch.com)
4. Copy the CNAME target provided
5. Add CNAME record in your DNS provider:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: @ (or your subdomain)
   Value: [Railway CNAME target]
   TTL: Auto
   ```

### 6. Verify Deployment

Once deployed, test these URLs:
- https://your-app.railway.app (or your custom domain)
- https://your-app.railway.app/books
- https://your-app.railway.app/marketing
- https://your-app.railway.app/writing

### 7. Initialize Database

After first deployment, you may want to seed some data:

SSH into Railway or use Railway CLI:
```bash
railway run python seed_data.py
railway run python seed_marketing_writing_tools.py
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Still Failing?
1. Check Railway build logs for specific errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Make sure MongoDB URI is correct and accessible

### App Not Starting?
1. Check Deploy Logs in Railway
2. Verify PORT environment variable is being used
3. Check MongoDB connection string format

### Database Connection Issues?
1. Whitelist 0.0.0.0/0 in MongoDB Atlas
2. Check MongoDB URI format
3. Verify database user has read/write permissions

### Need More Memory?
1. Upgrade Railway plan if needed
2. Or optimize by adding pagination
3. Add caching for frequent queries
